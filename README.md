# Sudoku-Solver-with-GeneticAlgorithms-
In the presented notebook, I attempt to solve the Sudoku puzzle using genetic algorithm. In order to do that, I first solve the N-queens problem with evolutionary computing and then use a similar technique and generalize to the sudoku puzzle.

The ingredients for a generic genetic algorithms are the following:
- **Population**: we start with a randomly generated population;
- **Fitness funtion**: every individual or group is valuated with a "quality" metrics;
- **Selection procedure**: one or more individuals are used in order to give life to children;
- **Crossover**: how parents create children;
- **Mutation**: how children mutate;
- Continue until **Terminal Condition** is satisfied.

In the notebook I will explain firmly the used techniques applied to the Sudoku Database.
